Sorry - I'm trying to report an issue I'm having & can not find a place to post it - issue template is not available to me.
I will post it here - If anyone can tell me how & where it belongs I'll be happy to post it there.  Here goes nothing...

i have an ISSUE with kernel panic following sleep if the computer is attempting to download a large file(s) overnight.
I'm running Monterey with the latest OpenCore Legacy patch + Post Patches on a mid-2010 15" MacBookPRO.
Here's the thing - Sleep & Wake-up seem to work when I'm using the machine normally but not if left alone for a long period - 
like overnight.
I've included a TEXT file with the Kernel Error Report & some specifics about my Mac - let me know if I've forgotten something 
important.
Please put this in the correct location or repository & send me a note on what I don't know how to do... thanks so much!
